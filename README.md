# Aurora Asset Editor

A simple graphical editor for the Aurora dashboard's library asset files.

**Notice**:
This project has been moved [here](https://github.com/XboxUnity/AuroraAssetEditor)

There will be more features added to this tool as I find the time to do so, first version only supports reading/writing `.asset` files.

A Huge thanks goes out to MaesterRowen for explaining the format for me, and also for making the `AuroraAsset.dll` library which handles the image conversion _(between D3DTexture and Bitmap)_
Many thanks also goes to Mattie for the placeholder images :)

Thanks also goes to gavin_darkglider & felida for helping me test this thing :)

Thanks to RAP7HOR for the icon used in the application as of version 1.1!
